      "body": "From:  https://github.com/EntrustCorporation/draft-ounsworth-composite-sigs/issues/147\r\n\r\nBelow are some comments, suggestions, and questions based on a brief review of draft-ounsworth-pq-composite-sigs-13.\r\n\r\nGeneral\r\n\r\nThe draft defines a set of 13 algorithms. Is LAMPS the right forum to vet algorithms? Generally, LAMPS deals with specs that describe how to use a given algorithm relative to PKIX and S/MIME artifacts, not algorithm specifications.\r\nIs the \"Internet PKI\" really the target? Is this kind of designation appropriate for what would appear to be a general-purpose algorithm specification?\r\nThe draft needs a thorough review to sharpen the fact that it now defines a set of 13 algorithms, not a framework for using composite key and signature combinations. Statements like \"should be regarded as a single key\" muddy the water. Even the term \"composite key\" is unhelpful. It's likely that most instances of the word \"composite\" could be written \"Composite ML-DSA.\" Given that this spec defines a means of generating and using keys and signatures, there's no need for all the \"drop-in replacement\" verbiage.\r\nOffhand, I think all of the relevant structures could use templates. Assuming this is correct, it may be worth including a section that notes ASN.1 decoders/encoders are not required.\r\nAll references to \"explicit composites\" should be reviewed and either deleted or amended.\r\nAbstract\r\n\r\nIs a \"X.509, PKIX, and CMS\" target appropriate for an algorithm specification? Is there some reason any of these 13 algorithms could not be used in a different context?\r\ns/Signaturem/Signature\r\nSections 2.3.1 - 2.3.3\r\n\r\nThese sections should include references to the relevant sections of each possible component algorithm. There is a list of algorithms in Section 5 (with a broken link for ML-DSA) but, given this is an algorithm specification, including more detail in the key generation, signature generation and signature verification sections would be appropriate and helpful.\r\ns/sketched/defined\r\nThere are two references to \"recursive composite public keys.\" These should be removed given they are not supported by definition.\r\nSection 2.3.1\r\n\r\ns/The KeyGen() -> (pk, sk) of a composite signature algorithm will perform the KeyGen() of the respective component signature algorithms / KeyGen() will perform the KeyGen() of the respective component signature algorithms\r\nIt's probably worth including pseudocode as done for Sign() and Verify()\r\nRewrite the last sentence to be Composite ML-DSA specific: The component keys MUST be uniquely generated for use in a Composite ML-DSA key.\r\nSection 2.3.2\r\n\r\nThe second and third steps could use some work. In step 2, S1 and S2 are raw signatures from a component algorithm. In step 3, they are BIT STRINGs containing the raw signatures. Additionally, it is unlikely the \"algorithm specifications\" address encoding as a BIT STRING. Suggest rewriting bullet 3 as below:\r\n\r\nEncode each component signature S1 and S2 as BIT STRINGs B1 and B2 then as a SEQUENCE\r\n\r\nsignature ::= Sequence { B1, B2 }\r\n\r\ns/A composite signature MUST produce/Sign() MUST produce\r\n\r\nSection 2.4\r\n\r\nDrop the word concatenation. No OIDs are being concatenated. There are other references to OID concatenation throughout the document that should be reviewed as well.\r\nSection 2.6\r\n\r\nDepending on the answer to the first question in General above, the following sentence may need to be removed or amended: \"If other combinations are needed, a separate specification should be submitted to the IETF LAMPS working group.\"\r\nThe statement that this \"also does not preclude future specification from extending these structures\" is false. The definitions are fixed at length 2. That someone could define a new specification with other lengths need not be commented on here. Suggest removing this sentence.\r\nSection 3\r\n\r\nReplace \"multiple algorithms\" with \"algorithm pairs\" or similar. Same comment applies throughout the draft.\r\nFWIW, I did not test compile the ASN.1 or work with the examples yet.\r\nGiven ECPoint is an alias for OCTET STRING do we need to ability to define types for each component, or can the object class be simplified to assert all component keys are simply OCTET STRINGs?\r\nSection 3.2\r\n\r\nThe reference to Table 3 is not altogether apt. The table lists signature algorithms. There should probably be a similar table for use in reconstituting SubjectPublicKeyInfo values (i.e., including curve name for parameters).\r\nSection 3.4\r\n\r\nWhy is this section necessary? The public key format defined by this specification is CompositeSignaturePublicKey. If someone wants to encode this in an OCTET STRING or BIT STRING that's their business.\r\nI would delete the entire section, but if the section remains, I would definitely delete the last sentence. The definitions provided call for DER encoding. Immediately following that with allowance for BER in the \u201cinterests of simplicity and avoiding compatibility issues\u201d is odd in that it provides for neither. If you want to support BER and DER, cite BER encoding. But why do that? Amongst other things, that would break ability to templatize the artifacts.\r\nSection 5\r\n\r\nRemove \"for explicit combinations\" from the first sentence.\r\nRemove the second paragraph given the list is exhaustive for this specification.\r\nRemove the third paragraph since only 13 algorithms are defined. There is no flexibility provided for in this specification to define other combinations.\r\nSecurity Considerations\r\n\r\nThis section should incorporate security considerations from component algorithms by reference.\r\nThe section still reflects the earlier versions before the scope was limited to focus on 13 algorithms. It could use some pruning. Maybe move some of the stripping discussion to the signature generation section.\r\nAll considerations are listed under the same heading. These should be broken up into new subsections (or the heading removed).\r\nSection B.2\r\n\r\nThis section (and subsections) should probably be deleted. At a minimum, they aren't really \"Implementation considerations\" for the 13 algorithms that are the subject of the draft.",

Also the term is not clearly defined. Hence, it could be understood as \"full strength of classical+PQ\" and that is opposite to what NIST FAQ [1] says. I.e. let say MLDSA is FIPS-approved in a future, and we create composite with MLDSA-44 + some on-ramp signature that claims level 5. Does it mean the strength of that construct should be considered FIPS-approved with security strength of equal to level 2 or 5?\r\n\r\nAs this draft is now about creating composite signatures with MLDSA, so do we need B.1? The discussion about FIPS-approved dual signature schemes sounds like a great discussion to have, but in a different place (and ideally on CMUF forum).\r\n\r\nMy suggestion would be to remove B.1 to avoid spreading potentially misleading information about important topic.\r\n\r\nAdditional nit:\r\n\r\nThe abstract says \"Composite algorithms are provided which combine ML-DSA with RSA, ECDSA, Ed25519, and Ed448.\".

Additionally we should have a rational why we do not include the PreHash OID here. Or include this also.\r\n\r\nThis said, this whole thing only makes sense during the development phase, because we dont know the MLDSA OIDs yet. But once they are fixed, also our combination matrix is fixed with new and official CompSig OIDs. So just Hashing the CompSig OID would do the same job and is much easier to describe in the signature algorithm.\r\nI am afraid reviewers would reject the compilation algorithm for the same reason.\r\n\r\nSo the question is, do we want to go the whole way of flexibility and define the compilation algorithm (that I would gladly do and maybe reuse for the kofn algorithm) or do we go the shortcut.\r\n\r\nWhat do you think? Do I miss something here?",

This would indicate a \"typical\" salt length of 32 for id-MLDSA44-RSA2048-PSS-SHA256 and 64 id-MLDSA65-RSA3072-PSS-SHA512\r\n\r\nRFC 8017 section 9.1 says this:\r\n\r\nTypical salt lengths in octets are hLen (the length of the output\r\n       of the hash function Hash) and 0.  In both cases, the security of\r\n       RSASSA-PSS can be closely related to the hardness of inverting\r\n       RSAVP1. \r\n\r\nFrom Tim Holobeek:\r\n\r\nHello,\r\n\r\nOur engineering team has been looking at composite signatures, and found a potential ambiguity.  The draft uses OIDs for everything, with no parameters (good), but this begs the question of what the right parameters are for rsa-pss, in particular the salt length, which isn\u2019t included in the parameters table.\r\n\r\nThere\u2019s also the question of what the right answer is, which honestly I haven\u2019t had time to review.  They\u2019re saying that RFC 4055 suggests matching the length of the hash in its security considerations section, which sounds reasonable, but Openssl seems to be hard-coded to always use 64 bytes of salt.  Which sounds right to me for SHA512 but not necessarily SHA256.",

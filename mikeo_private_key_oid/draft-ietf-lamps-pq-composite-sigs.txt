                Composite ML-DSA for use in Internet PKI
               draft-ietf-lamps-pq-composite-sigs-latest

Abstract

   This document introduces a set of signature schemes that use pairs of
   cryptographic elements such as public keys and signatures to combine
   their security properties.  These schemes effectively mitigate risks
   associated with the adoption of post-quantum cryptography and are
   fully compatible with existing X.509, PKIX, and CMS data structures
   and protocols.  This document defines thirteen specific pairwise
   combinations, called ML-DSA Composite Schemes, that blend ML-DSA with
   traditional algorithms such as RSA, ECDSA, Ed25519, and Ed448.  These
   combinations are tailored to meet security best practices and
   regulatory requirements.  Composite ML-DSA is applicable in any
   application that would otherwise use ML-DSA, but wants the protection
   against breaks or catastrophic bugs in ML-DSA.

2.  Introduction

   The advent of quantum computing poses a significant threat to current
   cryptographic systems.  Traditional cryptographic algorithms such as
   RSA, Diffie-Hellman, DSA, and their elliptic curve variants are
   vulnerable to quantum attacks.  During the transition to post-quantum
   cryptography (PQC), there is considerable uncertainty regarding the
   robustness of both existing and new cryptographic algorithms.  While
   we can no longer fully trust traditional cryptography, we also cannot
   immediately place complete trust in post-quantum replacements until
   they have undergone extensive scrutiny and real-world testing to
   uncover and rectify potential implementation flaws.

   Unlike previous migrations between cryptographic algorithms, the
   decision of when to migrate and which algorithms to adopt is far from
   straightforward.  Even after the migration period, it may be
   advantageous for an entity's cryptographic identity to incorporate
   multiple public-key algorithms to enhance security.

   Cautious implementers may opt to combine cryptographic algorithms in
   such a way that an attacker would need to break all of them
   simultaneously to compromise the protected data.  These mechanisms
   are referred to as Post-Quantum/Traditional (PQ/T) Hybrids
   [I-D.driscoll-pqt-hybrid-terminology].

   Certain jurisdictions are already recommending or mandating that PQC
   lattice schemes be used exclusively within a PQ/T hybrid framework.
   The use of Composite scheme provides a straightforward implementation
   of hybrid solutions compatible with (and advocated by) some
   governments and cybersecurity agencies [BSI2021].

   Composite ML-DSA is applicable in any application that would
   otherwise use ML-DSA, but wants the protection against breaks or
   catastrophic bugs in ML-DSA.

2.1.  Conventions and Terminology

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "NOT RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and
   "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in
   BCP 14 [RFC2119] [RFC8174] when, and only when, they appear in all
   capitals, as shown here.  These words may also appear in this
   document in lower case as plain English words, absent their normative
   meanings.

   This document is consistent with the terminology defined in
   [I-D.driscoll-pqt-hybrid-terminology].  In addition, the following
   terminology is used throughout this document:

   ALGORITHM: A standardized cryptographic primitive, as well as any
   ASN.1 structures needed for encoding data and metadata needed to use
   the algorithm.  This document is primarily concerned with algorithms
   for producing digital signatures.

   BER: Basic Encoding Rules (BER) as defined in [X.690].

   CLIENT: Any software that is making use of a cryptographic key.  This
   includes a signer, verifier, encrypter, decrypter.

   COMPONENT ALGORITHM: A single basic algorithm which is contained
   within a composite algorithm.

   COMPOSITE ALGORITHM: An algorithm which is a sequence of two
   component algorithms, as defined in Section 5.

   DER: Distinguished Encoding Rules as defined in [X.690].

   LEGACY: For the purposes of this document, a legacy algorithm is any
   cryptographic algorithm currently in use which is not believed to be
   resistant to quantum cryptanalysis.

   PKI: Public Key Infrastructure, as defined in [RFC5280].

   POST-QUANTUM ALGORITHM: Any cryptographic algorithm which is believed
   to be resistant to classical and quantum cryptanalysis, such as the
   algorithms being considered for standardization by NIST.

   PUBLIC / PRIVATE KEY: The public and private portion of an asymmetric
   cryptographic key, making no assumptions about which algorithm.

   SIGNATURE: A digital cryptographic signature, making no assumptions
   about which algorithm.

   STRIPPING ATTACK: An attack in which the attacker is able to
   downgrade the cryptographic object to an attacker-chosen subset of
   original set of component algorithms in such a way that it is not
   detectable by the receiver.  For example, substituting a composite
   public key or signature for a version with fewer components.

3.  Composite Signatures Schemes

   The engineering principle behind the definition of Composite schemes
   is to define a new family of algorithms that combines the use of
   cryptographic operations from two different ones: ML-DSA one and a
   traditional one.  The complexity of combining security properties
   from the selected two algorithms is handled at the cryptographic
   library or cryptographic module, thus minimal changes are expected at
   the application or protocol level.  Composite schemes are fully
   compatible with the X.509 model: composite public keys, composite
   private keys, and ciphertexts can be carried in existing data
   structures and protocols such as PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210],
   X.509 [RFC5280], CMS [RFC5652], and the Trust Anchor Format
   [RFC5914].

   Composite schemes are defined as cryptographic primitives that
   consists of three algorithms:

   *  KeyGen() -> (pk, sk): A probabilistic key generation algorithm,
      which generates a public key pk and a secret key sk.

   *  Sign(sk, Message) -> (signature): A signing algorithm which takes
      as input a secret key sk and a Message, and outputs a signature

   *  Verify(pk, Message, signature) -> true or false: A verification
      algorithm which takes as input a public key, a Message, and a
      signature and outputs true if the signature verifies correctly.
      Thus it proves the Message was signed with the secret key
      associated with the public key and verifies the integrity of the
      Message.  If the signature and public key cannot verify the
      Message, it returns false.

   A composite signature allows the security properties of the two
   underlying algorithms to be combined via standard signature
   operations such as generation and verify and can be used in all
   applications that use signatures without the need for changes in data
   structures or protocol messages.

3.1.  Composite Schemes PreHashing

   Composite schemes' signature generation process and composite
   signature verification process are designed to provide security
   properties meant to address specific issues related to the use
   multiple algorithms and they require the use of pre-hasing.  In
   Composite schemes, the value of the DER encoding of the selected
   signature scheme is concatenated with the calculated Hash over the
   original message.

   The output is then used as input for the Sign() and Verify()
   functions.

4.  Cryptographic Primitives

4.1.  Key Generation

   To generate a new keypair for Composite schemes, the KeyGen() -> (pk,
   sk) function is used.  The KeyGen() function calls the two key
   generation functions of the component algorithms for the Composite
   keypair in no particular order.  Multi-process or multi-threaded
   applications might choose to execute the key generation functions in
   parallel for better key generation performance.

   The generated public key structure is described in Section 5.2, while
   the corresponding composite secret key structure is defined in
   Section 5.3.

   The following process is used to generate composite keypair values:

   KeyGen() -> (pk, sk)

   Input:
        sk_1, sk_2         Private keys for each component.

        pk_1, pk_2         Public keys for each component.

        A1, A2             Component signature algorithms.

   Output:
        (pk, sk)           The composite keypair.

   Function KeyGen():

     (pk_1, sk_1) <- A1.KeyGen()
     (pk_2, sk_2) <- A2.KeyGen()

     if NOT (pk_1, sk_1) or NOT (pk_2, sk_2):
       // Component key generation failure
       return NULL

     (pk, sk) <- encode[(pk_1, sk_1), (pk_2, sk_2)]
     if NOT (pk, sk):
       // Encoding failure
       return False

     // Success
     return (pk, sk)

                     Figure 1: Composite KeyGen(pk, sk)

   The key generation functions MUST be executed for both algorithms.
   Compliant parties MUST NOT use or import component keys that are used
   in other contexts, combinations, or by themselves (i.e., not only in
   X.509 certificates).

4.2.  Signature Generation

   Composite schemes' signatures provide important properties for multi-
   key environments such as non-separability and key-binding.  For more
   information on the additional security properties and their
   applicability to multi-key or hybrid environments, please refer to
   [I-D.hale-pquip-hybrid-signature-spectrums] and the use of labels as
   defined in [Bindel2017]

   Composite signature generation starts with pre-hashing the message
   that is concatenated with the Domain separator Section 7.1.  After
   that, the signature process for each component algorithm is invoked
   and the values are then placed in the CompositeSignatureValue
   structure defined in Section 6.1.

   A composite signature's value MUST include two signature components
   and MUST be in the same order as the components from the
   corresponding signing key.

   The following process is used to generate composite signature values.

Sign (sk, Message) -> (signature)
Input:
     K1, K2             Signing private keys for each component. See note below on
                        composite inputs.

     A1, A2             Component signature algorithms. See note below on
                        composite inputs.

     Message            The Message to be signed, an octet string

     HASH               The Message Digest Algorithm used for pre-hashing.  See section
                        on pre-hashing below.

     Domain             Domain separator value for binding the signature to the Composite OID.
                        See section on Domain Separators below.

Output:
     signature          The composite signature, a CompositeSignatureValue

Signature Generation Process:

   1. Compute the new Message M' by concatenating the Domain identifier (i.e., the DER encoding of the Composite signature algorithm identifier) with the Hash of the Message

         M' := Domain || HASH(Message)

   2. Generate the 2 component signatures independently, by calculating the signature over M'
      according to their algorithm specifications that might involve the use of the hash-n-sign paradigm.

         S1 := Sign( K1, A1, M' )
         S2 := Sign( K2, A2, M' )

   3. Encode each component signature S1 and S2 into a BIT STRING
      according to its algorithm specification.

        signature := NULL

        IF (S1 != NULL) and (S2 != NULL):
          signature := Sequence { S1, S2 }

   4. Output signature

        return signature

                Figure 2: Composite Sign(sk, Message)

   It is possible to construct CompositePrivateKey(s) to generate
   signatures from component keys stored in separate software or
   hardware keystores.  Variations in the process to accommodate
   particular private key storage mechanisms are considered to be
   conformant to this document so long as it produces the same output as
   the process sketched above.

4.3.  Signature Verify

   Verification of a composite signature involves reconstructing the M'
   message first by concatenating the Domain separator (i.e., the DER
   encoding of the used Composite scheme's OID) with the Hash of the
   original message and then applying each component algorithm's
   verification process to the new message M'.

   Compliant applications MUST output "Valid signature" (true) if and
   only if all component signatures were successfully validated, and
   "Invalid signature" (false) otherwise.

   The following process is used to perform this verification.

Composite Verify(pk, Message, signature)
Input:
     P1, P2             Public verification keys. See note below on
                        composite inputs.

     Message            Message whose signature is to be verified,
                        an octet string.

     signature          CompositeSignatureValue containing the component
                        signature values (S1 and S2) to be verified.

     A1, A2             Component signature algorithms. See note
                        below on composite inputs.

     HASH               The Message Digest Algorithm for pre-hashing.  See
                        section on pre-hashing the message below.

     Domain             Domain separator value for binding the signature to the Composite OID.
                        See section on Domain Separators below.

Output:
    Validity (bool)    "Valid signature" (true) if the composite
                        signature is valid, "Invalid signature"
                        (false) otherwise.

Signature Verification Procedure::
   1. Check keys, signatures, and algorithms lists for consistency.

      If Error during Desequencing, or the sequences have
      different numbers of elements, or any of the public keys
      P1 or P2 and the algorithm identifiers A1 or A2 are
      composite then output "Invalid signature" and stop.

   2. Compute a Hash of the Message

         M' = Domain || HASH(Message)

   3. Check each component signature individually, according to its
       algorithm specification.
       If any fail, then the entire signature validation fails.

       if not verify( P1, M', S1, A1 ) then
            output "Invalid signature"
       if not verify( P2, M', S2, A2 ) then
            output "Invalid signature"

       if all succeeded, then
        output "Valid signature"

          Figure 3: Composite Verify(pk, Message, signature)

   It is possible to construct CompositePublicKey(s) to verify
   signatures from component keys stored in separate software or
   hardware keystores.  Variations in the process to accommodate
   particular private key storage mechanisms are considered to be
   conformant to this document so long as it produces the same output as
   the process sketched above.

5.  Composite Key Structures

   In order for signatures to be composed of multiple algorithms, we
   define encodings consisting of a sequence of signature primitives
   (aka "component algorithms") such that these structures can be used
   as a drop-in replacement for existing signature fields such as those
   found in PKCS#10 [RFC2986], CMP [RFC4210], X.509 [RFC5280], CMS
   [RFC5652].

5.1.  pk-CompositeSignature

   The following ASN.1 structures represent a composite public key
   combined with an RSA and Elliptic Curve public key, respectively.

   RsaCompositeSignaturePublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
           firstPublicKey BIT STRING (ENCODED BY id-raw-key),
           secondPublicKey BIT STRING (CONTAINING RSAPublicKey)
         }

   EcCompositeSignaturePublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
           firstPublicKey BIT STRING (ENCODED BY id-raw-key),
           secondPublicKey BIT STRING (CONTAINING ECPoint)
         }

   EdCompositeSignaturePublicKey ::= SEQUENCE {
           firstPublicKey BIT STRING (ENCODED BY id-raw-key),
           secondPublicKey BIT STRING (CONTAINING id-raw-key)
         }

   id-raw-key is defined by this document.

   This structure is intentionally generic in the first public key slot
   since ML-DSA, as defined in [I-D.ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates],
   does not define any ASN.1 public key structures.  For use with this
   document, the firstPublicKey MUST be the BIT STRING representation of
   an ML-DSA key as specified in
   [I-D.ietf-lamps-dilithium-certificates].  Note that here we used BIT
   STRING rather than OCTET STRING so that these keys can be trivially
   transcoded into a SubjectPublicKeyInfo as necessary, for example when
   a crypto library requires this for invoking the component algorithm.
   The public key for Edwards curve DSA component is also encoded as a
   raw key.

   The following ASN.1 Information Object Class is defined to then allow
   for compact definitions of each composite algorithm.

   pk-CompositeSignature {OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id, PublicKeyType}
       PUBLIC-KEY ::= {
         IDENTIFIER id
         KEY PublicKeyType
         PARAMS ARE absent
         CERT-KEY-USAGE { digitalSignature, nonRepudiation, keyCertSign, cRLSign}
       }

   As an example, the public key type pk-MLDSA44-ECDSA-P256-SHA256 is
   defined as:

   pk-MLDSA44-ECDSA-P256-SHA256 PUBLIC-KEY ::=
     pk-CompositeSignature{ id-MLDSA44-ECDSA-P256-SHA256,
     EcCompositeSignaturePublicKey}

   The full set of key types defined by this specification can be found
   in the ASN.1 Module in Section 9.

5.2.  CompositeSignaturePublicKey

   Composite public key data is represented by the following structure:

   CompositeSignaturePublicKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF BIT STRING

   A composite key MUST contain two component public keys.  The order of
   the component keys is determined by the definition of the
   corresponding algorithm identifier as defined in section Section 7.

   Some applications may need to reconstruct the SubjectPublicKeyInfo
   objects corresponding to each component public key.  Table 2 in
   Section 7 provides the necessary mapping between composite and their
   component algorithms for doing this reconstruction.  This also
   motivates the design choice of SEQUENCE OF BIT STRING instead of
   SEQUENCE OF OCTET STRING; using BIT STRING allows for easier
   transcription between CompositeSignaturePublicKey and
   SubjectPublicKeyInfo.

   When the CompositeSignaturePublicKey must be provided in octet string
   or bit string format, the data structure is encoded as specified in
   Section 5.4.

   Component keys of a CompositeSignaturePublicKey MUST NOT be used in
   any other type of key or as a standalone key.

5.3.  CompositeSignaturePrivateKey

   Use cases that require an interoperable encoding for composite
   private keys, such as when private keys are carried in PKCS #12
   [RFC7292], CMP [RFC4210] or CRMF [RFC4211] MUST use the following
   structure.

   CompositeSignaturePrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF OneAsymmetricKey

   Each element is a OneAsymmetricKey` [RFC5958] object for a component
   private key.

   The parameters field MUST be absent.

   The order of the component keys is the same as the order defined in
   Section 5.2 for the components of CompositeSignaturePublicKey.

   Often, a CompositePrivateKey will be carried within a carrier format
   such as PKCS#8 which is itself a OneAsymmetricKey structure (version
   1 of which is also known as PrivateKeyInfo) [RFC5958], then a
   situation arises where we have CompositeKEMPrivateKey ::= SEQUENCE
   SIZE (2) OF OneAsymmetricKey inside another OneAsymmetricKey.  On the
   outer OneAsymmetricKey, the privateKeyAlgorithm field SHALL be set to
   the corresponding composite algorithm identifier defined according to
   Section 7, the privateKey field SHALL contain the
   CompositeKEMPrivateKey, and the publicKey field MUST NOT be present.
   The publicKey field of the component OneAsymmetricKeys remain
   OPTIONAL.  Which AlgorithmIDs to place into the component
   OneAsymmetricKeys is ambiguous; since
   OneAsymmetricKey.PrivateKeyAlgorithmIdentifier.AlgorithmID is not
   optional, producers MUST place something here and MAY either
   duplicate the composite AlgorithmID into both components, or MAY
   place the AlgorithmID of the component algorithm.  Parsers SHOULD
   ignore the component private key AlgorithmIDs and assume that the
   private keys are in the same order as specified in Table 2.

   In some usecases the private keys that comprise a composite key may
   not be represented in a single structure or even be contained in a
   single cryptographic module; for example if one component is within
   the FIPS boundary of a cryptographic module and the other is not; see
   {sec-fips} for more discussion.  The establishment of correspondence
   between public keys in a CompositeSignaturePublicKey and private keys
   not represented in a single composite structure is beyond the scope
   of this document.

   Component keys of a CompositeSignaturePrivateKey MUST NOT be used in
   any other type of key or as a standalone key.

5.4.  Encoding Rules

   Many protocol specifications will require that the composite public
   key and composite private key data structures be represented by an
   octet string or bit string.

   When an octet string is required, the DER encoding of the composite
   data structure SHALL be used directly.

   CompositeSignaturePublicKeyOs ::= OCTET STRING (CONTAINING
                                   CompositeSignaturePublicKey ENCODED BY der)

   When a bit string is required, the octets of the DER encoded
   composite data structure SHALL be used as the bits of the bit string,
   with the most significant bit of the first octet becoming the first
   bit, and so on, ending with the least significant bit of the last
   octet becoming the last bit of the bit string.

   CompositeSignaturePublicKeyBs ::= BIT STRING (CONTAINING
                                   CompositeSignaturePublicKey ENCODED BY der)

   In the interests of simplicity and avoiding compatibility issues,
   implementations that parse these structures MAY accept both BER and
   DER.

5.5.  Key Usage Bits

   For protocols such as X.509 [RFC5280] that specify key usage along
   with the public key, then the composite public key associated with a
   composite signature MUST have a signing-type key usage.  This is
   because the composite public key can only be used in situations that
   are appropriate for both component algorithms, so even if the
   classical component key supports both signing and encryption, the
   post-quantum algorithms do not.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in a Certification Authority
   (CA) certificate that indicates a composite key, then any combination
   of the following values MAY be present and any other values MUST NOT
   be present:

   digitalSignature;
   nonRepudiation;
   keyCertSign; and
   cRLSign.

   If the keyUsage extension is present in an End Entity (EE)
   certificate that indicates a composite key, then any combination of
   the following values MAY be present and any other values MUST NOT be
   present:

   digitalSignature; and
   nonRepudiation;

6.  Composite Signature Structures

6.1.  sa-CompositeSignature

   The ASN.1 algorithm object for a composite signature is:

   sa-CompositeSignature{OBJECT IDENTIFIER:id,
      PUBLIC-KEY:publicKeyType }
         SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM ::=  {
            IDENTIFIER id
            VALUE CompositeSignatureValue
            PARAMS ARE absent
            PUBLIC-KEYS {publicKeyType}
         }

   The following is an explanation how SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM elements are
   used to create Composite Signatures:

    +=============================+===================================+
    | SIGNATURE-ALGORITHM element | Definition                        |
    +=============================+===================================+
    | IDENTIFIER                  | The Object ID used to identify    |
    |                             | the composite Signature Algorithm |
    +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | VALUE                       | The Sequence of BIT STRINGS for   |
    |                             | each component signature value    |
    +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | PARAMS                      | Parameters are absent             |
    +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+
    | PUBLIC-KEYS                 | The composite key required to     |
    |                             | produce the composite signature   |
    +-----------------------------+-----------------------------------+

                                  Table 1

6.2.  CompositeSignatureValue

   The output of the composite signature algorithm is the DER encoding
   of the following structure:

   CompositeSignatureValue ::= SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF BIT STRING

   Where each BIT STRING within the SEQUENCE is a signature value
   produced by one of the component keys.  It MUST contain one signature
   value produced by each component algorithm, and in the same order as
   specified in the object identifier.

   The choice of SEQUENCE SIZE (2) OF BIT STRING, rather than for
   example a single BIT STRING containing the concatenated signature
   values, is to gracefully handle variable-length signature values by
   taking advantage of ASN.1's built-in length fields.

7.  Algorithm Identifiers

   This section defines the algorithm identifiers for explicit
   combinations.  For simplicity and prototyping purposes, the signature
   algorithm object identifiers specified in this document are the same
   as the composite key object Identifiers.  A proper implementation
   should not presume that the object ID of a composite key will be the
   same as its composite signature algorithm.

   This section is not intended to be exhaustive and other authors may
   define other composite signature algorithms so long as they are
   compatible with the structures and processes defined in this and
   companion public and private key documents.

   Some use-cases desire the flexibility for clients to use any
   combination of supported algorithms, while others desire the rigidity
   of explicitly-specified combinations of algorithms.

   The following table summarizes the details for each explicit
   composite signature algorithms:

   The OID referenced are TBD for prototyping only, and the following
   prefix is used for each:

   replace <CompSig> with the String "2.16.840.1.114027.80.8.1"

   Therefore <CompSig>.21 is equal to 2.16.840.1.114027.80.8.1.21

7.2.  Notes on id-MLDSA44-RSA2048-PSS-SHA256

   Use of RSA-PSS [RFC8017] deserves a special explanation.

   The RSA component keys MUST be generated at the 2048-bit security
   level in order to match with ML-DSA-44

   As with the other composite signature algorithms, when id-

8.  Use in CMS

   [EDNOTE: The convention in LAMPS is to specify algorithms and their
   CMS conventions in separate documents.  Here we have presented them
   in the same document, but this section has been written so that it
   can easily be moved to a standalone document.]

   Composite Signature algorithms MAY be employed for one or more
   recipients in the CMS signed-data content type [RFC5652].

8.1.  Underlying Components

   When a particular Composite Signature OID is supported in CMS, an
   implementation SHOULD support the corresponding Secure Hash algorithm
   identifier in Table 7 that was used as the pre-hash.

   The following table lists the MANDATORY HASH algorithms to preserve
   security and performance characteristics of each composite algorithm.

                Table 7: Composite Signature SHA Algorithms

   where:

   *  SHA2 instantiations are defined in [FIPS180].

8.2.  SignedData Conventions

   As specified in CMS [RFC5652], the digital signature is produced from
   the message digest and the signer's private key.  The signature is
   computed over different values depending on whether signed attributes
   are absent or present.

   When signed attributes are absent, the composite signature is
   computed over the content.  When signed attributes are present, a
   hash is computed over the content using the same hash function that
   is used in the composite pre-hash, and then a message-digest
   attribute is constructed to contain the resulting hash value, and
   then the result of DER encoding the set of signed attributes, which
   MUST include a content-type attribute and a message-digest attribute,
   and then the composite signature is computed over the DER-encoded
   output.  In summary:

   IF (signed attributes are absent)
      THEN Composite_Sign(content)
   ELSE message-digest attribute = Hash(content);
      Composite_Sign(DER(SignedAttributes))

   When using Composite Signatures, the fields in the SignerInfo are
   used as follows:

   digestAlgorithm: The digestAlgorithm contains the one-way hash
   function used by the CMS signer.

   signatureAlgorithm: The signatureAlgorithm MUST contain one of the
   the Composite Signature algorithm identifiers as specified in Table 7

   signature: The signature field contains the signature value resulting
   from the composite signing operation of the specified
   signatureAlgorithm.

8.3.  Certificate Conventions

   The conventions specified in this section augment RFC 5280 [RFC5280].

   The willingness to accept a composite Signature Algorithm MAY be
   signaled by the use of the SMIMECapabilities Attribute as specified
   in Section 2.5.2. of [RFC8551] or the SMIMECapabilities certificate
   extension as specified in [RFC4262].

   The intended application for the public key MAY be indicated in the
   key usage certificate extension as specified in Section 4.2.1.3 of
   [RFC5280].  If the keyUsage extension is present in a certificate
   that conveys a composite Signature public key, then the key usage
   extension MUST contain only the following value:

   digitalSignature
   nonRepudiation
   keyCertSign
   cRLSign

   The keyEncipherment and dataEncipherment values MUST NOT be present.
   That is, a public key intended to be employed only with a composite
   signature algorithm MUST NOT also be employed for data encryption.
   This requirement does not carry any particular security
   consideration; only the convention that signature keys be identified
   with 'digitalSignature','nonRepudiation','keyCertSign' or 'cRLSign'
   key usages.

8.4.  SMIMECapabilities Attribute Conventions

   Section 2.5.2 of [RFC8551] defines the SMIMECapabilities attribute to
   announce a partial list of algorithms that an S/MIME implementation
   can support.  When constructing a CMS signed-data content type
   [RFC5652], a compliant implementation MAY include the
   SMIMECapabilities attribute that announces support for the RSA-KEM
   Algorithm.

   The SMIMECapability SEQUENCE representing a composite signature
   Algorithm MUST include the appropriate object identifier as per
   Table 7 in the capabilityID field.

   Module Identifier" registry [RFC7299] for the included ASN.1 module,
   and allocate values from "SMI Security for PKIX Algorithms" to
   identify the fourteen Algorithms defined within.

11.  Security Considerations

11.1.  Public Key Algorithm Selection Criteria

   The composite algorithm combinations defined in this document were
   chosen according to the following guidelines:

   1.  RSA combinations are provided at a key size of 2048, 3072, and
       4096 bits matched with NIST PQC Level 2 and 3 algorithms.

   2.  Elliptic curve algorithms are provided with combinations on each
       of the NIST [RFC6090], Brainpool [RFC5639], and Edwards [RFC7748]
       curves.  NIST PQC Levels 1 - 3 algorithms are matched with
       256-bit curves, while NIST levels 4 - 5 are matched with 384-bit
       elliptic curves.  This provides a balance between matching
       classical security levels of post-quantum and traditional
       algorithms, and also selecting elliptic curves which already have
       wide adoption.

   3.  NIST level 1 candidates are provided, matched with 256-bit
       elliptic curves, intended for constrained use cases.

   If other combinations are needed, a separate specification should be
   submitted to the IETF LAMPS working group.  To ease implementation,
   these specifications are encouraged to follow the construction
   pattern of the algorithms specified in this document.

   The composite structures defined in this specification allow only for
   pairs of algorithms.  This also does not preclude future
   specification from extending these structures to define combinations
   with three or more components.

11.2.  PreHashing Algorithm Selection Criteria

   As noted in the composite signature generation process and composite
   signature verification process, the Message should be pre-hashed into
   M' with the digest algorithm specified in the composite signature
   algorithm identifier.  The selection of the digest algorithm was
   chosen with the following criteria:

   1.  For composites paired with RSA or ECDSA, the hashing algorithm
       SHA256 or SHA512 is used as part of the RSA or ECDSA signature
       algorithm and is therefore also used as the composite prehashing
       algorithm.

   2.  For ML-DSA [FIPS.204-ipd] signing a digest of the message is
       allowed as long as the hash function provides at least y bits of
       classical security strength against both collision and second
       preimage attacks.  For ML-DSA-44 y is 128 bits, for ML-DSA-65 y
       is 192 bits and for ML-DSA-87 y is 256 bits.  Therefore SHA256 is
       paired with RSA and ECDSA with ML-DSA-44 and SHA512 is paired
       with RSA and ECDSA with ML-DSA-65 and ML-DSA-87 to match the
       appropriate security strength.

   3.  Ed25519 [RFC8032] uses SHA512 internally, therefore SHA512 is
       used to pre-hash the message when Ed25519 is a component
       algorithm.

   4.  Ed448 [RFC8032] uses SHAKE256 internally, but to reduce the set
       of prehashing algorihtms, SHA512 was selected to pre-hash the
       message when Ed448 is a component algorithm.

11.3.  Policy for Deprecated and Acceptable Algorithms

   Traditionally, a public key, certificate, or signature contains a
   single cryptographic algorithm.  If and when an algorithm becomes
   deprecated (for example, RSA-512, or SHA1), then clients performing
   signatures or verifications should be updated to adhere to
   appropriate policies.

   In the composite model this is less obvious since implementers may
   decide that certain cryptographic algorithms have complementary
   security properties and are acceptable in combination even though one
   or both algorithms are deprecated for individual use.  As such, a
   single composite public key or certificate may contain a mixture of
   deprecated and non-deprecated algorithms.

   Since composite algorithms are registered independently of their
   component algorithms, their deprecation can be handled independently
   from that of their component algorithms.  For example a cryptographic
   policy might continue to allow id-MLDSA65-ECDSA-P256-SHA512 even
   after ECDSA-P256 is deprecated.

   When considering stripping attacks, one need consider the case where
   an attacker has fully compromised one of the component algorithms to
   the point that they can produce forged signatures that appear valid
   under one of the component public keys, and thus fool a victim
   verifier into accepting a forged signature.  The protection against
   this attack relies on the victim verifier trusting the pair of public
   keys as a single composite key, and not trusting the individual
   component keys by themselves.

   Specifically, in order to achieve this non-separability property,
   this specification makes two assumptions about how the verifier will
   establish trust in a composite public key:

   1.  This specification assumes that all of the component keys within
       a composite key are freshly generated for the composite; ie a
       given public key MUST NOT appear as a component within a
       composite key and also within single-algorithm constructions.

   2.  This specification assumes that composite public keys will be
       bound in a structure that contains a signature over the public
       key (for example, an X.509 Certificate [RFC5280]), which is
       chained back to a trust anchor, and where that signature
       algorithm is at least as strong as the composite public key that
       it is protecting.

   There are mechanisms within Internet PKI where trusted public keys do
   not appear within signed structures -- such as the Trust Anchor
   format defined in [RFC5914].  In such cases, it is the responsibility
   of implementers to ensure that trusted composite keys are distributed
   in a way that is tamper-resistant and does not allow the component
   keys to be trusted independently.

Appendix C.  Implementation Considerations

C.1.  FIPS certification

   One of the primary design goals of this specification is for the
   overall composite algorithm to be able to be considered FIPS-approved
   even when one of the component algorithms is not.

   Implementors seeking FIPS certification of a composite Signature
   algorithm where only one of the component algorithms has been FIPS-
   validated or FIPS-approved should credit the FIPS-validated component
   algorithm with full security strength, the non-FIPS-validated
   component algorithm with zero security, and the overall composite
   should be considered at least as strong and thus FIPS-approved.

   The authors wish to note that this gives composite algorithms great
   future utility both for future cryptographic migrations as well as
   bridging across jurisdictions, for example defining composite
   algorithms which combine FIPS cryptography with cryptography from a
   different national standards body.

C.2.  Backwards Compatibility

   The term "backwards compatibility" is used here to mean something
   more specific; that existing systems as they are deployed today can
   interoperate with the upgraded systems of the future.  This draft
   explicitly does not provide backwards compatibility, only upgraded
   systems will understand the OIDs defined in this document.

   If backwards compatibility is required, then additional mechanisms
   will be needed.  Migration and interoperability concerns need to be
   thought about in the context of various types of protocols that make
   use of X.509 and PKIX with relation to digital signature objects,
   from online negotiated protocols such as TLS 1.3 [RFC8446] and IKEv2
   [RFC7296], to non-negotiated asynchronous protocols such as S/MIME
   signed email [RFC8551], document signing such as in the context of
   the European eIDAS regulations [eIDAS2014], and publicly trusted code
   signing [codeSigningBRsv2.8], as well as myriad other standardized
   and proprietary protocols and applications that leverage CMS
   [RFC5652] signed structures.  Composite simplifies the protocol
   design work because it can be implemented as a signature algorithm
   that fits into existing systems.

C.2.1.  Hybrid Extensions (Keys and Signatures)

   The use of Composite Crypto provides the possibility to process
   multiple algorithms without changing the logic of applications but
   updating the cryptographic libraries: one-time change across the
   whole system.  However, when it is not possible to upgrade the crypto
   engines/libraries, it is possible to leverage X.509 extensions to
   encode the additional keys and signatures.  When the custom
   extensions are not marked critical, although this approach provides
   the most backward-compatible approach where clients can simply ignore
   the post-quantum (or extra) keys and signatures, it also requires all
   applications to be updated for correctly processing multiple
   algorithms together.
